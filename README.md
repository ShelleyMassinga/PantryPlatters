## How the code works

`pantryplatter.py` and `forms.py` provide the backend for the PantryPlatter program, with the files in `templates` and `static` providing the frontend.
PantryPlatter is a "what's in your fridge" recipe finder, using ingredients the user has to provide recipes. Users can create an account and save recipes to return to in the future.
